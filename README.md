# Boilerplate for Angular 2 using Webpack 2

## Commands
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test` (Not Implemented)

## TODOs
- Unit Test Implementation
- Support multiple platforms (e.g. NativeScript)
- Tree Shaking (Rob Wormald is making progress on this but there are blockers, notably TS config "Cannot compile modules into 'es2015' when targeting 'ES5' or lower.")
- Integrate Offline Compiler (when stable/workable)
